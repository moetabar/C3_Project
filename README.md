1- In order to run run_analysis.R you need the dplyr library in case you do not have it then please download the package

2- please copy the run_analysis.R to your Working directory

3- The "UCI HAR Dataset" folder should be also in the same directory that has run_analysis.R file.

4- Then source it: source("run_analysis.R")

5- Now run it like: run_analysis() -- it may give you warning during loading the dplyr package, ignore it!

6- The code will walk you through the different steps it takes and finally will generate the result in two formats result.txt and result.csv, the second one is easier and cleaner for browsing

6. Thanks :)
